# üìè EchoReads Development Rules (Read by AI Tools like Cursor)

> This file acts as the **source of truth** for AI-assisted development. It defines strict rules for Cursor/Gemini to follow during code generation.

---

## ‚úÖ Required Technologies

- React Native with **Expo**
- **expo-router** for navigation (file-based)
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management
- **Zod + React Hook Form** for forms and validation
- **Axios** for API calls with interceptors
- **expo-secure-store** for storing JWTs and user prefs
- **expo-localization** for i18n and language support
- **Moti** or **Reanimated v3** for animations and transitions
- **lottie-react-native** for Lottie animations
- **babel-plugin-module-resolver** for path aliases

---

## üõ† Enforced Patterns

### 1. üìÅ Project Structure Must Follow:

Do not place logic inside `/app`. Only screens go here.

---

### 2. üé® Theming System Must Use:

- `src/theme/ThemeContext.tsx`
- `src/hooks/useTheme.ts`
- Must support Light, Dark, and System modes
- Should be available globally via `_layout.tsx` and Context API

---

### 3. üßæ Forms Must Use:

- `react-hook-form`
- `zod` for schema validation
- Must use custom `FormProvider` wrapper (defined in `/form/`)

---

### 4. ‚ùå Prohibited Patterns:

- ‚ùå No inline styling
- ‚ùå No `useState` for theme, language, or auth
- ‚ùå No screen logic outside `/app`
- ‚ùå No unapproved packages unless added to `RULES.md`

---

### 5. üìú Documentation Enforcement:

- Every new screen, component, or feature must **update `/README.md`**
- Every new tech/package/method must **update `/RULES.md`**

Cursor must keep this documentation in sync **automatically**.

---

üìå **Cursor Behavior Override:**
> From now on, Cursor must obey this `RULES.md` file. No unapproved tech should be used in suggestions or autogeneration.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Cursor & AI Guidelines

- Always read and respect this file before generating or modifying code.
- Only use libraries explicitly listed in the **Required Technologies** section.
- Do not install or suggest new libraries without user confirmation and `RULES.md` update.
- Any new tool, library, or pattern must be added to this file **before use**.
- Always update `/README.md` and `/RULES.md` after completing any module, screen, or feature.
